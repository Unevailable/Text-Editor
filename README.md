## Installation
* I first started you need to have to repos two [Book-Search-FE](https://github.com/Unevailable/Book--Search-FE) and [Book-Search-BE](https://github.com/Unevailable/Book--Search-BE)
* do the required npm i's in each folder (backend npm i express and cors) (frontend npm i)
* deploy your backend on render and make sure that in the server.js it has your Netlify link in origin.
* deploy your frontend on Netlify and make sure that in the app.jsx it has your render link in URI with /graphql at the end of the render link.

## Usage
The purpose of this full-stack application is for a user to have a place where they can create a library/list of their favorite/saved books. 

## Git Repos Used
Since this project required the separation of the frontend and backend each repo will be linked.
* MERN Full-Stack [Book-Search-Engine](https://github.com/Unevailable/Book-Search-Engine) (WARNING: Trying to deploy this onto any server will not work.)
* Frontend [Book-Search-FE](https://github.com/Unevailable/Book--Search-FE)
